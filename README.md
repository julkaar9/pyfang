Utilize the full power of python while writing html and css.

## Important
This package is currently in open-beta, so there isn't any stable public version yet.   
The design philoshopy might change until 1.0.0 is released.  

Only a fraction of the HTML tags are covered, however you can use the `RawTag` and `RawAttr` or `DefaultAttr` to write any html tag.
